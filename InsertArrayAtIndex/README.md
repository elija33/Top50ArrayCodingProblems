                                                    Array insert at index
Insertion is a basic but frequently used opeartion. Arrays in most languages cannot be dynamically shrinked or expanded. Here, we will work with such arrays and try to insert an element at some index.

You are given an array arr(0-based index). The size of the array is given by sizeOfArray. 
You need to insert an element at given index and print the modified array.

Example 1:

Input:
sizeOfArray = 6
arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
index = 5, element = 90
Output: 1 2 3 4 5 90
Explanation: 90 is inserted at index
5(0-based indexing). After inserting,
array elements are like
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 90.
