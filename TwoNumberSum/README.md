# Top50ArrayCodingProblems
Given an array of distinct integers and an integer representing the target sum, we are asked to implement a function that is going to find out whether there's a pair of numbers in the array that adds up to the target sum. If such pair exists, return the pair in any order; otherwise return an empty array. We cannot add a number to itself to get the target sum.

Example:
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9.

The output should be [0, 1]. 
Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9.

Example 2:
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 26.

The output should be [2, 3]. 
Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 11 + 15 = 9.
